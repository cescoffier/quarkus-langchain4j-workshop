The workshop is divided into 7 steps. Each step builds on the previous one, adding new features and functionality.</p> <p>We start from the base functionality (step 1) and add features in the subsequent steps. The result after each step is located in a separate directory (<code>step-XX</code>). The final solution is in the <code>step-07</code> directory.</p> <p>We recommend to start by checking out the main branch and then opening the project from <code>step-01</code> in your IDE and using that directory throughout the workshop. The other option is to make a copy of it. If you later need to reset to a particular step, either overwrite your working directory with the directory for the step you want to reset to, or, in your IDE, open the project from the step directory you want to reset to.</p>"},{"location":"#lets-get-started","title":"Let\u2019s get started!","text":"<p>Go to the requirements page to prepare for the workshop.

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and gained valuable insights into building AI-infused applications.</p> <p>In just a few hours, we built an intelligent chatbot using Quarkus and Quarkus LangChain4j, demonstrating how to integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities into a modern application.  Throughout the process, we explored key concepts, including:</p> <ul> <li>Integrating a large language model (LLM) seamlessly within a Quarkus application</li> <li>Utilizing annotations to efficiently pass prompts and structure interactions</li> <li>Implementing the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern to enrich responses with external data</li> <li>Leveraging function calling to create agents\u2014LLMs that can reason and interact with various system components</li> <li>Implementing guardrails to safeguard against common risks, such as prompt injection and LLM misbehavior</li> </ul> <p>By the end of this tutorial, you should now have a solid foundation for building AI-enhanced applications with Quarkus, using its powerful tools to create smarter, more responsive systems.

It actually can interact with any model serving the OpenAI API (like vLLM or Podman AI Lab). Quarkus LangChain4j abstracts the complexity of calling the model and provides a simple API to interact with it.</p> <p>In our case, the application is a simple chatbot. It uses a WebSocket, this is why you can also see the following dependency in the <code>pom.xml</code> file:</p> <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-websockets-next&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>If you now open the <code>src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/quarkus/workshop/CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket.java</code>  file, you can see how the web socket is implemented:</p> CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket.java<pre><code>package dev.langchain4j.quarkus.workshop;\n\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnOpen;\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnTextMessage;\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocket;\n\n@WebSocket(path = \"/customer-support-agent\")\npublic class CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket {\n\n    private final CustomerSupportAgent customerSupportAgent;\n\n    public CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket(CustomerSupportAgent customerSupportAgent) {\n        this.customerSupportAgent = customerSupportAgent;\n    }\n\n    @OnOpen\n    public String onOpen() {\n        return \"Welcome to Miles of Smiles!

An AI service is an object managed by the Quarkus LangChain4j extension. It models the interaction with the AI model. As you can see it\u2019s an interface, not a concrete class, so you don\u2019t need to implement anything (thanks Quarkus!). Quarkus LangChain4j will provide an implementation for you at build time. Thus, your application only interacts with the methods defined in the interface.</p> <p>There is a single method in this interface, <code>chat</code>, but you could name the method whatever you wanted. It takes a user message as input (as it\u2019s the only parameter, we consider it to be the user message) and returns the response from the AI model. How this is done is abstracted away by Quarkus LangChain4j.</p> <p><code>SessionScoped</code>?</p> <p>Attentive readers might have noticed the <code>@SessionScoped</code> annotation. This is a CDI annotation which scopes the object to the session. In our case the session is the web socket. The session starts when the user connects to the web socket and ends when the user disconnects. This annotation indicates that the <code>CustomerSupportAgent</code> object is created when the session starts and destroyed when the session ends. It influences the memory of our chatbot, as it remembers the conversation that happened so far in this session.</p> <p>So far, so good!

When using function calling, this threat becomes even more significant, as prompt injection can lead to unintended actions within your application. For instance, a user could craft inputs that deceive the model into triggering functions with malicious parameters, causing the system to behave unexpectedly, such as retrieving sensitive data, calling external APIs without authorization, or disrupting critical operations.</p> <p>The nature of LLMs makes them particularly susceptible to these attacks because they are trained to follow natural language instructions, which can be exploited to alter their intended logic. An attacker could insert hidden commands in user inputs, tricking the LLM into executing unintended functions.</p> <p>To mitigate prompt injection, developers should implement validation mechanisms, such as input sanitization and strict control over which functions the model is allowed to call. Additionally, leveraging guardrails, such as defining explicit constraints and using LLM oversight, can help ensure that malicious inputs are effectively neutralized.</p> <p>In the following sections, we will explore how to implement guardrails to protect your application from prompt injection.
